    #### Welcome to AGRIINSIGHT: Your Farming Partner for Optimal Growth! üå±üìäüåøüîç
    AGRIINSIGHT is an innovative app designed to help farmers optimize fertilizer usage and ensure plant health. By analyzing soil conditions, crop type, and local weather data, we provide personalized fertilizer recommendations while also identifying potential plant diseases‚Äîempowering farmers to increase productivity while maintaining environmental sustainability.Our mission is to help in identifying plant diseases efficiently.
    Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to detect any signs of diseases. Together, let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest!
    
    ### How AGRIINSIGHT Works:
    ##### 1.**Input Data:** Upload images of your plants  and the soil where it is grown.
    ##### 2.**Smart Analysis:** AGRIINSIGHT‚Äôs advanced algorithms analyze your input to recommend the ideal fertilizer usage and detect plant diseases.
    ##### 3.**Instant Recommendations:** Receive actionable insights and suggestions to enhance crop yields and ensure sustainable farming practices.

                #### About Our Dataset üìä

                The dataset powering AGRIINSIGHT was carefully recreated through offline augmentation from the original dataset, which can be found in the associated GitHub repo. It contains approximately 87,000 RGB images of both healthy and diseased crop leaves, categorized into 38 different plant disease classes
                The dataset is split into training and validation sets in an 80/20 ratio while preserving the directory structure for easier management. Additionally, a separate directory with 33 test images was created to assist with prediction tasks.

                #### Dataset Breakdown:
                1. Train Set (1000 images)
                2. Test Set(20 images)
